# Expansion Backplane for Minimal 64x4 Computer

This backplane allows connecting of up to 4 expansion cards to the Minimal 64x4 computer. The [expansion connector](./hardware/expansion-connector/) is a convenient way to connect the backplane to the Minimal 64x4 computer.

### Shared `INH` Line
To have multiple cards connected to the backplane, they need to share the active high `INH` inhibit line. If multiple cards are emitting a LOW signal directly, and one emits a HIGH, contention will occur. To prevent such contention, the back plane uses a 74HCT126 to arbitrate the `INH` signal's orrigression from a card to the Minimal 64x4's exansion port. Each of the buffers in teh 74HCT126 have their input signal tied high, and the each card's `INH` output us used to control the output enable for it's assigned buffer. In this way, when a card's `INH` output is low (not active), it's corresponding buffer has its output in a high-Z state. In this way if another card assert's it's `INH` line high, there won't be bus contention back to the card. But each card's active high `INH` signal is passed through to the Minimal 64x4. The downside is that each expansion card cannot monitor whether another card is asserting the `INH` signal. This is not deemed to be a signficant issues since Minimal 64x4 expansion board are generally memory mapped, and thus only one can be actively writing to the bus at a time.


### Power Barrel Jack
The back plane provides a convenient standard 2.1 mm barrel jack you may use to connect to a regulated `5V` power supply to power the expansion cards and additionally power the Minimal 64x4 computer. If this barrel jack is connected to power, be sure to not connect the UART's `+5V` line to the Minimal 64x4 (still connect `GND`)
